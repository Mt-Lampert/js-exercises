# Welcome!

So you want to practice JS? Then this "project" here should help you out.

Inside you will find what I call "drill exercises" to practice some medium to advanced JavaScript and TypeScript stuff. "Drill exercises" means that you will practice the same coding concepts over and over again to give you routine, so that you can face real world coding challenges with more self-efficacy.

## How this project is organized

Everything that happens, happens inside the `/src` folder.

Inside the `/src` folder you will find:

* a `README.md` file that gives you a little introduction into the topic and outlines the exercises for this topic. You should consult it 
* several '.js' files that contain the exercises for you
* a `__tests__` folder that contains the Jest specs for examining your results. If you know how Jest specs work,  you are welcome to comment the tests out you don't want to be run at the moment.
* Maybe subfolders (that are organized as described) if the topic is too vast and too diverse to fit into one single folder.

## Install

At the moment, this project has just seen the light of day. However, you will need NodeJS and npm to use it. If you want to install it, here's what you should do:

In a coding directory of you choice, open your favorite CLI to do the following three simple steps:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Mt-Lampert/js-exercises.git
$ cd js-exercises
$ npm install
$ npm run test
```

You should see at least one test passing.

Happy Exercising!
