# Welcome!

So you want to practice JS? Then this "project" here should help you out.

Inside you will find what I call "drill exercises" to practice some medium to advanced JavaScript and TypeScript stuff. "Drill exercises" means that you will practice the same coding concepts over and over again to give you routine, so that you can face real world coding challenges with more self-efficacy.

## Install

At the moment, this project has just seen the light of day. However, you will need NodeJS and npm to use it. If you want to install it, here's what you should do:

In a coding directory of you choice, open your favorite CLI to do the following three simple steps:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Mt-Lampert/js-exercises.git
$ cd js-exercises
$ npm install
$ npm run test
```

You should see at least one test passing.

Happy Exercising!
